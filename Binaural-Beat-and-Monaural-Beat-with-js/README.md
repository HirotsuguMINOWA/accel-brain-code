# Binaural Beat and Monaural Beat with JavaScript

This application enables you to handle your mind state by a kind of "Brain-Wave Controller" which is generally known as Biaural beat or Monauarl beats in a simplified method. 

## Description

These modules are functionally equivalent to Python Scripts in [AccelBrainBeat](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Binaural-Beat-and-Monaural-Beat-with-python).

## More detail

 The function of this library is inducing you to be extreme immersive mind state on the path to peak performance. You can handle your mind state by using this library which is able to control your brain waves by the binaural beats and the monaural beats.

### Concept of Binaural beats and Monauarl beats

 According to a popular theory, brain waves such as Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma rhythms tend to be correlated with mind states. The delta waves(1-3 Hz) are regarded as the slowest brain waves that are typically produced during the deep stages of sleep. The theta waves(4-7 Hz) are offen induced by the meditative state or focusing the mind. The alpha waves(8-12 Hz) are associate with relaxed state. The beta waves(13-29 Hz) are normal waking consciousness. The Gamma waves(30-100 Hz) are the fastest of the brain waves and associated with peak concentration and the brain's optimal frequency for cognitive functioning.

 By a theory of the binaural beats, signals of two different frequencies from headphone or earphone are presented separately, one to each ear, your brain detects the phase variation between the frequencies and tries to reconcile that difference. The effect on the brain waves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone. For example, if 400 Hz was played in one ear and 430 in the other, then the binaural beats would have a frequency of 30 Hz.

 The monaural beats are similar to the binaural beats. But they vary in distinct ways. The binaural beats seem to be "created" or perceived by cortical areas combining the two different frequencies. On the other hand, the monaural beats are due to direct stimulation of the basilar membrane. This makes it possible to hear the beats.

 Please choose either binaural beets or monaural beats. If you set up 5 Hz, your brain waves and the frequency can be tuned and then you are able to be the meditative state or focusing the mind. Or what you choose to be relaxed state is the alpha waves(8-12 Hz).
